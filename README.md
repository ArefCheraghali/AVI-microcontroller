# MicroClock
 AVI microcontroller program source codes

This project is a micro-controller programming source code that is usefull for taking a rtc input and displaying it on the LCD
In addition to clock and calendar, I added a feature to grab temperature input from a thermometer and displays it on the LCD

The main prject file(LCD Clock Calendar.pdsprj) is a proteus simulation that I inserted the C codes into the main chip
you can run the simulation using the proteus software

The main C program and project files are located in the codevision folder
